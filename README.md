# First steps with Power Query for Microsoft Excel

Resources for course, "[First steps with Power Query for Microsoft Excel](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/first-steps-with-power-query-for-microsoft-excel/0636920376538/)". 

Power Query is a Microsoft extract, transform, and load (ETL) technology that enables users to access data from structured and unstructured sources, reshape it, and load it into Excel workbooks.

Analysts, researchers, and project managers want to build repeatable data cleaning processes on large datasets. Rather than write complex Excel formulas or programs in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), these users can conduct their work in Power Query with no coding required.

The focus of this course will be using Power Query to transform tabular data sources into tables that are ready for data analysis. By the end of the course, users will be able to pivot, filter, and merge data so that it’s ready for analysis in Excel.

## **What you'll learn-and how you can apply it**

**By the end of this live, hands-on, online course, you’ll understand**:

- How Power Query serves as an ETL tool for Microsoft Excel
- What makes data “tidy,” and why tidiness is desirable for data analysis
- The role of the M programming language in Power Query

**And you’ll be able to**:

- Load data from Excel worksheets, workbooks and CSV files
- Perform common data wrangling tasks such as sorting, filtering, and aggregation
- Combine data from multiple sources using joins and appends
## **This training course is for you because...**
- You're an analyst responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data for business insights
- You frequently gather data from multiple sources to build reports in Excel
- You want to build repeatable data cleaning procedures with no code

**Prerequisites**

- You should be comfortable with basic tasks and functions in Excel, including sorting and filtering, and the use of IF statements. Ideally, you've also used conditional aggregates like SUMIF() and COUNTIF() as well as PivotTables and VLOOKUP().

**Recommended preparation**:

- Download and install [Power Query for Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379). Depending on your version of Excel, the steps will be different. See Microsoft’s [official compatibility guide](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Where-is-Get-Transform-Power-Query-E9332067-8E49-46FC-97FF-F2E1BFA0CB16). Please note that on a Mac, Power Query is only available on Office 365. If you need a refresher on Excel basics, consider:
